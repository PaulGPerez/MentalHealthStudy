Deliverables and steps taken:

Data Cleanup: Performed a full audit of the dataset to ensure data integrity.
Quality Assurance: Confirmed there were 0 duplicates, 0 missing values, and 0 outliers in key fields like Sleep Hours and Stress Levels

Statistical Analysis:
Testing: Ran hypothesis tests to determine if "Gender" or "Occupation" actually influence "Sleep" or "Stress".
The Results Sleep vs. Gender: 
A T-Test showed that males and females have nearly identical sleep averages. 
The difference was not statistically significant P value was higher than .05 (0.84) and the T statistic was not in the tail end as it was -.19, too close to zero.

Stress vs. Job: 
A Mann-Whitney test showed that being a "Student" vs "Employed" didn't show significant change in stress levels in this group the p value was = 0.44 higher than the standard alpha of .05.
